<td><center>eig</center></td>
<td><p>eig(1) :</p>
<p>eig(A) calculates 2D square matrix A's eigen vectors and eigen values. This function returns a two element list. First element is the eigen vector matrix, each column is an eigen vector. Second element is a diagonal matrix. Each diagonal element is an eigen value. Note that this function needs big memory to run and consumes significant CPU time. If running in mobile device, size of A and B should be no greater than 6*6. If running on PC, A and B should be no greater than 8*8. Otherwise, it may fail because lack of memory or run for very long time.</p>
<p>eig(2) :</p>
<p>eig(A, B) calculates 2D square matrix A's eigen vectors and eigen values against same size matrix B, i.e. Av = lambda * Bv, where lambda is an eigen value and v is an eigen vector. The second parameter, B, is optional. By default, B is an I matrix. This function returns a two element list. First element is the eigen vector matrix, each column is an eigen vector. Second element is a diagonal matrix. Each diagonal element is an eigen value. Note that this function needs big memory to run and consumes significant CPU time. If running in mobile device, size of A and B should be no greater than 6*6. If running on PC, A and B should be no greater than 8*8.

<td><center>get_extreme_elem</center></td>
<td><p>get_extreme_elem(3) :</p>
<p>Function get_extreme_elem analyses input dataArray and returns the maximum or minimum element in the data array. If an element is not a real value, this function ignores it. It has three parameters. The first is data array (it can be a single value), the second is original max or min value. If this is not null and is a real value, the function compares selected max or min element with this parameter and returns the new max or min value. The third one is to tell the function to get max value or min value. 0 is for min value and 1 is for max value. Examples are get_extreme_elem([[2, 3], "hello", 5], null, 1) and get_extreme_elem([[3,4,6],[5+3i, 7, 9.88-4.61], [5.77 -0.03i]], -8, 0).</p>
